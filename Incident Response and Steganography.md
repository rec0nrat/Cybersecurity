### Exercise 1 
Define and explain the following elements related to incident response.
#### Task 1 - Incident Response Steps
List all the steps in a numbered list, and then separately explain each step in your own words.
1. Preparation: Practice, training, planning, document preparation, coordinating in anticipation or preparation for an incident. The preparation is all central to responding to a security breach. Preparation would involve conducting risk assessments, evaluating potential vulnerabilities,  establishing appropriate communication channels, and ensuring that business continuity plans are in place. Tool testing, parallel testing, and tabletop exercises are performed during this step. Regular testing and evaluation of the incident response plan ensures that it stays current and viable. This ensures that weakness in the plan are identified and improved ultimately improving the overall security posture. 
3. Detection: Involves detecting and verifying a breach. During this step an organization must decide if an event is actually an attack. Intrusion prevention and detection systems play a key role in this step. A threshold IoC/IoA must be reached in order to conclude that an incident has taken place.
4. Analysis: The extent of the attack and classification of the severity and mechanism has to defined. The impact scope of impact has to be defined as well.
5. Containment: Once Identified you need to contain the effected environment. This would involve taking infected systems offline or isolation in order to contain the threat and prevent the further spread of malware and attacker movement. The quicker this is done the more likely further damage is prevented. Do no delete evidence during this step.
6. Eradication: Investigation of the root cause and removing threats from the system. After all malware has been removed and there are no more traces of the threat, the systems need to be returned to their original configuration. Insight into protecting future threats and IoC/IoA can be gleamed from this step.
7. Recovery: The system must returned to its original state. Reintegrating the previously infected system and returning the network to normal as fast as possible are crucial to reducing impact to the company. Data may have recovered or rebuilt at this point as well.
8. Lessons Learned: After the incident is over a personal must be gathered together to present their findings and issues during the process. What was done well and what areas need improvement are questions asked during this step. Does policy need to be changed in light of this new information. The information here will help dictate how incidents are handled in the future.
#### Task 2 - Incident Response Phases
List all the phases in a numbered list, and then separately explain phase step in your own words.
1. Preparation: Preparation and planning for an incident. Collect information about your system and vulnerabilities taking action on your the finding to reduce risk. This phase is constant, performing table top exercises and tools testing, to be the most prepared for an incident at any moment. Information from the post-incident phase is fed into into the preparation phase to for constant development. If an incident does occur you go directly into the Detection and Analysis phase.
2. Detection and Analysis: Identification of suspicious activity and verification that the activity is truly an attack. Once identified, collection of data becomes primary so that it can be analyzed. The analysis must attempt to discover how severe the attack was and which parts of the system have been effected. Once the effected systems are identified and the malware pinpointed you move to containment, eradication and Recovery.
3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery: The previous phase should be as quick as possible in order to prevent further spread of the infected surface. The effected systems should be isolated and the malware irradicated. While removing the malware more more indicator trigger hidden IoCs or malware to surface. In this case The information is fed back to the detection and Analysis phase because more infected systems may be discovered armed with this new information. Once the root cause is discovered and removed the systems need to be brought back online. The original configurations need to be restored and data must be recovered or rebuilt. Once done, move to the post-incident activity phase. 
4. Post-Incident Activity: Review of of incident response process needs to be conducted. The incident response team and others involved are pulled together for an after action report. What went right or wrong? Improvements that need to be made and lessons learned. Did anything impede the process? Can information from this incident and the response be applied to prevent future attacks or to reduce recovery time? The information from the after action report is then implemented by passing it off to the preparation phase.

#### Task 3 - Incident Response Policy
Explain what the purpose of an incident policy is in your own words.

An incident response policy specifies actions to be taken under if certain conditions are met. It establishes procedures necessary in dealing with a threat or breach. The more fine tuned this policy is the quicker the response time may be, which in turn will help reduce the downtown and minimize damage.
#### Task 4 - Incident Response Plan
Explain what an IRP is, and what purpose does it play in your own words.

The incident response plan is similar to incident response policy. It is a written document that details how to deal with a security incident once it occurs. The goal is to reduce the overall impact, contain the breach, remediate the cause, return the system back to normal functionality, and reduce future risk. 
#### Task 5 - Communication Plan
Explain what a communication plan is, and what purpose does it play in your own words.

A communication plan outlines who to contact and what information is needs to be presented during response to an incident. Incident response requires careful coordination between response teams, management, authorities, stake holders, and spokes people. This insures the information presented is consistent and true without damaging the companies reputation or impeding an investigation.
#### Task 6 - Recon
Explain what an enumeration is, and what purpose does it play in your own words.

Enumeration is the act of establishing connection in order to gather information of network assets. This information could consist of network address, protocol specifics, web footprint, firewall detection, account credentials, and so on. It can be used to find weak or unknown parts of a network. 
#### Task 7 - Exfiltration
Explain what an tunneling is, and what purpose does it play in your own words.

Tunneling is the act of creating a secure connection between to points, across multiple networks acting as if they were directly connected, for the purpose of data transmission. To facilitate this secure connection the data packet is wrapped inside and encrypted within a second packet. Traffic is essentially isolated from exterior networks during transport. Tunneling is used to bypass firewalls, create VPN connections, and to enable the use of unsupported network protocols.
#### Task 8 - Communication
Explain what a pem file is, and what purpose does it play in your own words.

A Privacy Enhanced Mail or PEM file is a datafile containing cryptographic information, such as keys or certificates, that is stored in a standardized format. PEM files are part of Public Key Infrastructure or PKI. They are normally used for secure communication such as TLS/SSL, identification and verification of users and assets, data encryption, and code signing. 
#### Task 9 - The Dominican Republic Incident
1. Listen to this podcast on Incident Response: 
	- Darknet Diaries, Episode 135.
2. Explain what your take aways are from this podcast.

There are few major takeaways here. Firstly communication is key. Growing and nurturing contacts within the cyber field can give you an edge. These contacts can be called upon to help and will share threat information or response techniques that could be critical in the defense of your own systems. This is especially true if you are a smaller player and don't have the same resources as your competitors.

Omar talks about switching his focus from building defense to improving detection. I think this highlights the fact that an adversary may be able to penetrate your network, no matter how well you think you are protected, but if you can not detect the intrusion properly you can not respond appropriately. 

Dissemination of information is also necessary to make the community aware of the current threat landscape and to let others know who to ask if they detect similar issues. if the Dominican Republic Cyber Division had not contacted the other Latin countries, those countries may have not been able to fend off the attack.

Not only is communication and information sharing important between organizations and individuals, it's critical to contact and share issues with vendors and service providers so that vulnerable products can be fixed and appropriate action can be taken swiftly.
### Exercise 2 - Steganography (Windows)
#### Task 1 - Install openstego
1. Download OpenStego from: https://www.openstego.com/ 
2. Download the Source File from Github: https://github.com/ajay63/BlackTowerAcademy/blob/main/maxresdefault-2003057562.jpg
#### Task 2 - Dependencies
It is likely if OpenStego fails to run, its because it requires JAVA and you donâ€™t have it installed. 
One can easily and quietly install Java from https://ninite.com/

Often you may run into a situation where software a program is dependent on is not installed. If this is the case you need to find and install the proper software or dependencies before the program will function correctly. This is the case with OpenStego because it is missing the Java Develoopment Kit (JDK) software dependency. Once installed OpenStego should run just fine.

1. This is the original image file.
2. After running OpenStego this is the file that was produced.
OpenStego will hide the message data within the raw data of the image file. You must use the same program to extract the image because knows how to find the hidden data and properly extract it.
#### Task 5 - Data Extraction
Download the image file at the following location:
https://github.com/ajay63/BlackTowerAcademy/blob/main/evilphoto.png 

Extract the secret message and display it. Note that there is no password to input or order to complete extraction.
Refer to task 3 where we have already accomplished this task.
#### Task 6 - Classmate Data Extraction
Embed a secret in an image, then share the file with a classmate, and have him read the secret message back to you.

### Exercise 3 - Steganography (Linux)
Install steghide and use it to hide and extract a message from an image file.
#### Task 1 â€“ Installation
To install steg hide use 'apt'. run the following command on your linux server.
```
sudo apt install steghide -y
```
#### Task 2 â€“ Download and extract the secret
Download the following image:
https://github.com/ajay63/BlackTowerAcademy/blob/main/Funny-Cat-Hidden.jpg

The image file needs to be downloaded to your host machine. using wget will not work. Use scp to copy the image to your Linux server. Below is an example of the scp command.
![[Pasted image 20240418211019.png]]

Extract the message from the image using the following command.
![[Pasted image 20240418212635.png]]
#### Task 3 - Embed a secret into an image
Using steghide embed a secret into a file & share it with a classmate for them to decode

Embedding a message in an image 'stimpy.jpg'
Use scp to copy the image to the Linux server. Create a message using vim and store it in 'message.txt'. Use steghide to imbed message using 'loki97' for the encryption algorithm and '123456' as the password. The stego file produced is 'stimpy_123456.jpg'.
